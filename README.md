# PoissonBinomial
A python module implementing functions to approximately or efficiently compute Poisson Binomial distribution pmf cdf std and expectation.

The module implements both recursive and fft methods for computing Poisson Binomial Probability functions.
Poisson and the refinement of normal approximation are also implemented in the module.
For further details on implementations see the API comments.

Requirements:

Scipy, Numpy

This version was tested with python3.
python2 compatability was not checked, place an issue or correct and pull request if you have compatability issues with python2.
